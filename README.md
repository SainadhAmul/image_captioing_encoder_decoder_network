# Automatic Image Captioning

Automatic Image Captioning is a deep learning project that generates human-readable captions for images using a combination of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformers. In this project, we use PyTorch to create and train the models.

## Introduction

The goal of this project is to build an end-to-end image captioning system that can automatically generate textual descriptions for any given image. We will be using a pre-trained state-of-the-art model for the encoder (e.g., ResNet) and transformers for the decoder.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- PyTorch
- torchvision
- transformers
- torchtext
- Pillow
- NumPy
- tqdm

## Dataset

We will be using the [Flickr8k dataset](https://forms.illinois.edu/sec/1713398) for training and evaluating our image captioning model. The dataset contains over 8,000 images and 40,000 captions, providing a diverse set of examples for learning.

To download and prepare the dataset, follow these steps:

1. Request access to the Flickr8k dataset by filling out the [request form](https://forms.illinois.edu/sec/1713398).
2. Download the dataset and organize it into a folder structure like this:
data/
├── captions.txt
└── images/
├── train/
└── val/
3. Use the provided `preprocess_data` function to tokenize and preprocess the captions.

## Model Architecture

Our image captioning model consists of two main components:

1. **Encoder**: A pre-trained CNN (e.g., ResNet) is used to extract features from the input image. These features serve as the input to the decoder.
2. **Decoder**: A transformer-based architecture is used to generate the captions based on the features extracted by the encoder. The decoder is trained to predict the next word in the caption, given the current word and the image features.

## Training

To train the model, follow these steps:

1. Create a `DataLoader` object to load the preprocessed dataset.
2. Initialize the encoder and decoder models.
3. Set up the loss function and the optimizer.
4. Train the model using the provided `train` function, which iterates over the dataset and updates the model weights based on the predicted captions.

## Evaluation

Once the model is trained, you can evaluate its performance on the validation set using the provided `evaluate` function. This function calculates the BLEU score, which is a common metric used for evaluating image captioning models.

## Deployment

After training and evaluating the model, you can deploy it to generate captions for new images
